# Star Ratings With JavaScript And Fontawesome

In this small project, we are going to build a star rating javascript application for users to rate 4k TV on the market.

The app presents default star ratings of each TV brand in the form of star (using Fontawesome 5) with rating from 1 to 5. User can choose which television brand he/she wants to rate first and then followed by rating he likes to give. Once the rating has been decided, whenever the number rating number input is on blur, the chosen rating will be reflected in the number of stars for that TV brand.
